This includes:\n- `xfield`: A field with an unpartitioned x-direction (x-local)\n- `yfield`: A field with an unpartitioned y-direction (y-local)\n- `zfield`: A field with an unpartitioned z-direction (z-local)\n- one-dimensional buffers for performing communication between the different configurations, in particular:\n    - `yzbuffer`: A buffer for communication between the z- and y-configurations\n    - `xybuffer`: A buffer for communication between the y- and x-configurations\n  These buffers are \"packed\" with the three dimensional data and then \"unpacked\" in the target configuration once\n  received by the target rank.\n- `counts`: The size of the chunks in the buffers to be sent and received\n- `comms`: The MPI communicators for the yz and xy directions (different from MPI.COMM_WORLD!!!)\n\nA `TransposableField` object is used to perform distributed transpositions between different configurations with the \n`transpose_z_to_y!`, `transpose_y_to_x!`, `transpose_x_to_y!`, and `transpose_y_to_z!` functions. \nIn particular:\n- `transpose_z_to_y!` copies data from the z-configuration (`zfield`) to the y-configuration (`yfield`)\n- `transpose_y_to_x!` copies data from the y-configuration (`yfield`) to the x-configuration (`xfield`)\n- `transpose_x_to_y!` copies data from the x-configuration (`xfield`) to the y-configuration (`yfield`)\n- `transpose_y_to_z!` copies data from the y-configuration (`yfield`) to the z-configuration (`zfield`)\n\nFor more information on the transposition algorithm, see the docstring for the `transpose` functions.\n\n# Arguments\n- `field_in`: The input field. It needs to be in a _z-free_ configuration (i.e. ranks[3] == 1).\n- `FT`: The element type of the field. Defaults to the element type of `field_in`.\n- `with_halos`: A boolean indicating whether to include halos in the field. Defaults to `false`.\n" function TransposableField(field_in, FT = eltype(field_in); with_halos = false)
